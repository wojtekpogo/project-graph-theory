# What is a Regular Expression?

A regular expression also known as '**regex**' is a search pattern used for matching one or more characters within a string. It can match specific characters, [wildcards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildcard_character#:~:text=In%20regular%20expressions%2C%20the%20period,which%20matches%20any%20single%20character.&text=*%20it%20will%20match%20any%20number,known%20as%20the%20Kleene%20star.), and ranges of characters. 
> “A regular expression is a pattern which specifies a set of strings of characters; it is said to match certain strings.” —**Ken Thompson**<sup>1</sup> <sup>2</sup>
